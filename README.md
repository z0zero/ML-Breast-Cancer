# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a breast cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant. It leverages a dataset comprising various features related to breast cancer tumors.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 569 instances with 30 different features, including:
- Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- Compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- Concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- Concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- Symmetry
- Fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

Class Distribution: 212 Malignant, 357 Benign

Target Classes:
- Malignant
- Benign

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation using dataframes
- Numpy: For statistical analysis of the data
- Matplotlib: For data visualization
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization

## Steps Involved
1. Data Importing
2. [Further steps like Data Cleaning, Analysis, Model Building, etc., as per the notebook]
